# Testcase Example:  '[1,2,2,1]\n[2,2]'
#
# Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
# Output: [2,2]
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
# Output: [4,9]
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# Each element in the result should appear as many times as it shows in both
# arrays.
# The result can be in any order.
# 
# 
# Follow up:
# 
# 
# What if the given array is already sorted? How would you optimize your
# algorithm?
# What if nums1's size is small compared to nums2's size? Which algorithm is
# better?
# What if elements of nums2 are stored on disk, and the memory is limited such
# that you cannot load all elements into the memory at once?
#

class Solution:
    def intersect(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        from collections import Counter
        c1 = Counter(nums1)
        c2 = Counter(nums2)
        result = []
        for key, value in c1.items():
            if key in c2:
                result.extend([key] * min(c1[key], c2[key]))
        return result
